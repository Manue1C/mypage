  <p class="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
    Born in Westchester County, New York, to proud Ecuadorian immigrants, I am a first-generation American with a deep-seated passion for technology and innovation. My curiosity for computers was paralleled only by my love for sports and nature, leading me to become an Eagle Scout—an experience that taught me the value of perseverance and community.

    After earning an associate's degree in Business Administration, I felt a calling to serve and joined the Marines. For nine years, I dedicated myself to the Corps, starting as an Ammunition Technician and culminating as a Drill Instructor. The discipline and leadership skills honed there have been the bedrock of my personal and professional growth.

    Transitioning from the military, I pursued my interest in cybersecurity at Mercy University. It was during this time that I discovered a new passion—coding. Selected for the TechWise program, supported by Google, I trained intensively to become a software engineer. This unexpected journey into the world of code has not only complemented my cybersecurity expertise but has also ignited a creative spark for developing elegant solutions to complex problems.

  <p class="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
    Today, I stand as a Marine veteran, fitness enthusiast, cybersecurity graduate, and software developer. Currently, I'm a Security Analyst Intern and a Master's student in cybersecurity, ever ready to tackle the next challenge with the same focus and determination that has guided me throughout my life.
